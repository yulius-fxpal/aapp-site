# Scripts
# County Parser
This is an almost broken script which takes markdown from [Wikipedia
USA County
Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_and_county_equivalents)
and makes a little JSON out of it. It messes up a bit so it will
require some manual cleaning after the parse (or someone fixing the
regex).
